This is a recipe page project by RocketSeat, developed to practice advanced CSS concepts, HTML semantics, and good code organization practices.

## 🌸 **Technologies**
This project was developed using the following technologies:
- HTML5 (Semantic)
- CSS3 (Variables, Nesting, Flexbox)
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## 🌸 **Design and Functionalities**
The project features a sophisticated interface with the following highlights:
- **Dynamic Background:** Use of layers with `linear-gradient` and `blur` for depth.
- **Typography:** Use of the "Alice" font for a classic and legible look.
- **Responsiveness:** Adaptable layout for mobile devices using `max-width` and relative units.

## 🌸 **How to run the project**
1. **Clone this repository:** `git@github.com:Quin-shi-huan/recipe_page.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser or use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.

## 🌸 **Lessons Learned**
During development, I improved my skills in:
- Organizing CSS using a simplified BEM-based methodology.
- Using `backdrop-filter` and layer overlays.
- Standardizing commits for professional project history.
